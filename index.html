        <h1>Ten mindblowing facts about anything</h1>

        <h2>Number 1</h2>
        <p>
            I just started making this list without knowing what theme or content it would have.
    

        </p>

        <h2>Number 2</h2>
        <p>
            This is my first attempt at making a website.
        </p>

        <h2>Number 3</h2>
        <p>
            Lobsters urinate from their faces.
        </p>

        <h2>Number 4</h2>
        <p>
            This is the last item on the list. Mind=blown.
        </p>
